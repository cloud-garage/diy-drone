# DIY-DRONE
A DIY drone - built from scratch

## About
This is a students project. Our intention is to give anybody a chance to build their own drone (almost) from scratch. And we do it 'cause it's fun.

## Project
The project is divided into multiple sections/subfolders:

* __PCB__: Altium project files for the circuit board
* __CODE__: software for the Âµ-controller
* __BODY__: 3D-printable files (body, etc.)
* __APP__: mobile app for controlling the drone
* __OTHER__: build guide, manuals, tools and part list
